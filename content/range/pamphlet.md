Based on the great feedback we've had for the bespoke jobs that we've created pamphlets for, we've decided to make a range of off-the-peg pamphlets to make them available to all.

All of the detail you would usually add to the envelope can be included as part of the pamphlet (map and directions, menus, local information about hotels and taxis as well as any gift information), making this a really neat package that your guests are unlikely to mislay!
